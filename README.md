# Welcome to 995 Callister

We built this home in 2012, and in 2013, we brought home our dog and
our son. We welcomed our daughter a few years later. We hope that this
house will be a wonderful home for you and your loved ones!

## Maintenance

* If the bathrooms outlets are not working, the GFCI to reset it is in
the main floor powder room.

* The shutoff valve for the hose bib in the front of the house is in the
master bathroom under the right-side sink.

* The shutoff valve for the hose bib on the Southside of the house is
next to the water heater.

* The fireplace is a gas fireplace, but requires D cell batteries to
start. To change the batteries, lift the bottom metal face of the
fireplace and pull out.

* The [best carpet spot

we've found for the carpet in the basement and second floor.

* In addition to regular smoke detectors in each bedroom, there are
three [smoke/carbon monoxide
detectors](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B8VGHJH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)--one
on each floor. These were installed in March of 2020, to replace the
former smoke/CO detectors that had reached end of life.

### Programming the Garage Entry Pad

To program the garage entry pad:
1. Press * and # keys until lights stop flashing
2. Enter PIN
3. Press 3
4. Press Learning button on Opener
5. Enter PIN, then a number to test.

## Utilities

* To date, we have only used AT&T Uverse. Xfinity was not available when
we moved in. Our neighbors have since installed Xfinity. They had to
request xfinity business class so they could get hooked up, with the
intent to cancel business class and switch to residential after a
time.

* We use Infinite Energy for gas marketing--you could go with Atlanta
Gas Light or a number of other vendors, but Infinite Energy was nice
to use because they match the lowest prices we found on the [Georgia
Public Service Commission
website](https://psc.ga.gov/utilities/natural-gas/marketers-pricing-index/). We
pull that website up every year when we need to renew our rate, and
ask for the lowest rate that they match.

* Water Billing is through the Homeowners Association, billed quarterly (see the Homeowners Association section for informational links).

### Alarm

The alarm is currently unmonitored. The list of alarm zones is as follows:

1. Garage Door
2. Living
3. Basement, Powder
4. Dining
5. Den/Stairs/Deck
6. Motion Sensor
7. Front Door

The front door alarm zone is via a battery-powered wireless transmitter. The battery was replaced last year, and it lasted a bit over seven years.
