## Cable/Internet

To date, we have only used AT&T Uverse. Xfinity was not available when
we moved in. Our neighbors have since installed Xfinity. They had to
request xfinity business class so they could get hooked up, with the
intent to cancel business class and switch to residential after a
time.

## Electrical

If the bathrooms outlets are not working, the GFCI to reset it is in
the main floor powder room.

## Water

* The shutoff valve for the hose bib in the front of the house is in the
master bathroom under the right-side sink.

* The shutoff valve for the hose bib on the Southside of the house is
next to the water heater.

* The fireplace is a gas fireplace, but requires D cell batteries to
start. To change the batteries, lift the bottom metal face of the
fireplace and pull out.

We use Infinite Energy for gas marketing--you could go with Atlanta
Gas Light or a number of other vendors, but Infinite Energy was nice
to use because they match the lowest prices we found on the [Georgia
Public Service Commission
website](https://psc.ga.gov/utilities/natural-gas/marketers-pricing-index/).

The [best carpet spot
