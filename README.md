# Welcome to 995 Callister!

We built this home in 2012, and in 2013, we brought home our dog and
our son. We welcomed our daughter a few years later. We hope that this
house will be a wonderful home for you and your loved ones!

## Maintenance

* If the bathrooms outlets are not working, the GFCI to reset it is in
the main floor powder room.

* The shutoff valve for the hose bib in the front of the house is in the
master bathroom under the right-side sink.

* The shutoff valve for the hose bib on the Southside of the house is
next to the water heater.

* The fireplace is a gas fireplace, but requires D cell batteries to
start. To change the batteries, lift the bottom metal face of the
fireplace and pull out.

* The [best carpet spot

we've found for the carpet in the basement and second floor.

* In addition to regular smoke detectors in each bedroom, there are
three [smoke/carbon monoxide
detectors](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B8VGHJH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)--one
on each floor. These were installed in March of 2020, to replace the
former smoke/CO detectors that had reached end of life.

* There are several switches to control the kitchen can lights. One
controls the five lights on the outside. One controls the single can
light in the center. We installed the pendant lights on the same
switch as the center light, and left an old lightbulb in the center
can. Note: I've included images in this repo for the two lights that
appeared to be not working with a working bulb in them.

### Programming the Garage Entry Pad

To program the exterior garage entry pad:
1. Press * and # keys until lights stop flashing
2. Enter PIN
3. Press 3
4. Press Learning button on Opener
5. Enter PIN, then a nonzero number to test.

## Grounds

* The tree in the front yard tends to bloom late. If you're worried
that other trees in the neighborhood are getting full leaves and your
tree might be dead, just wait a couple of weeks, and it will be full
of leaves.

* The two Christmas-like trees on each side of the house need
occasional pruning. If you find roaches entering the house near the
master bathroom areas, check to see if these trees have branches
reaching to the roof line. If so, cut them back, because that's how
the roaches are getting in.

### Landscaping

We used [Horticultural Gardens](http://horticulturalgardens.net/) to
update the northern side yard. They added the slab stairs and the
slate chips, as well as directed the downspouts underground to French
drains leading to the the two plastic grates next to the mailbox.

We initially wanted to do the same treatment to both the North and
South side, but we couldn't come to an agreement with our neighbors on
the South. After the initial work, however, we realized that an
increase in accessible space meant an increase in foot traffic and
noise around the houses, so we were okay not landscaping the South
side.

## Utilities

* To date, we have only used AT&T Uverse. Xfinity was not available when
we moved in. Our neighbors have since installed Xfinity. They had to
request xfinity business class so they could get hooked up, with the
intent to cancel business class and switch to residential after a
time.

* We use Infinite Energy for gas marketing--you could go with Atlanta
Gas Light or a number of other vendors, but Infinite Energy was nice
to use because they match the lowest prices we found on the [Georgia
Public Service Commission
website](https://psc.ga.gov/utilities/natural-gas/marketers-pricing-index/). We
pull that website up every year when we need to renew our rate, and
ask for the lowest rate that they match.

* Water Billing is through the Homeowners Association, billed
quarterly (see the Homeowners Association section for informational
links).

### Alarm

The list of alarm zones is as follows:

1. Garage entry door
2. Living room windows
3. Basement and powder room windows
4. Dining room windows
5. Den/Stairs/Deck windows
6. Motion sensor located near front door
7. Front door

The front door alarm zone is via a battery-powered wireless
transmitter. The coin battery was replaced last year, and it lasted a
bit over seven years. Replacing the battery requires a plastic straw
to re-insert the sensor into the door frame.
